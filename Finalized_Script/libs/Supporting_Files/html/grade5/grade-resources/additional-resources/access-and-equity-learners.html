Meeting the Needs of Students Who Are Advanced Learners
</h1> 
<em>
By Marjorie McCabe, Ph.D. and Erin Marie Mason
</em>
<br><br><br> 
<h3 class="blue">
How can I recognize a range of advanced learners in my class?
</h3>
<p>In this section, we are focusing on students who perform or demonstrate the capacity to perform significantly above age-level peers in English Language Arts and English Language Development. Although it is up to each district to establish their own criteria for formal identification of advanced or gifted and talented learners, it is important for teachers to learn to recognize a range of advanced learners in their class and differentiate instruction to meet their needs whether formal identification exists or not. These students comprise a highly heterogeneous population, in terms of culture, language, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, gender, sexual orientation, age, and neurodiversity. It is especially common for advanced learners to go unrecognized when students exhibit their advanced learning in unfamiliar or inconsistent ways. In addition to the more familiar image of the “A” student who regularly masters grade-level concepts significantly faster than age-level peers, there is a much broader variety of advanced learners whose gifts and talents may go unnoticed on traditional measures of performance.
</p>
<br>
<h3 class="blue">
Tips for recognizing a range of advanced learners:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Advanced learners do not necessarily demonstrate advanced performance uniformly across all areas. Advanced learning may present itself in spikes of achievement in the areas of talent or interest.
</li>
<li>
Consider the stage of English language development for English learners, as well as their rate of progress. For example, imagine an English learner who begins the year with emerging English proficiency and is translating for peers by the end of the school year. This student may not demonstrate advanced abilities on typical English Language Arts tests yet. However, he or she may be best served by strategies for advanced learners since the student is exhibiting accelerated learning and talent in second language acquisition (or English language development).
</li>
<li>
English learners will need sheltered instruction techniques to access the content and demonstrate their learning. Non-sheltered instructional strategies and assessments may not provide true opportunity to learn and may not reveal their advancement or talents.
</li>
<li>
Students with disabilities can be twice exceptional. A student may have a disability that affects one area and may be gifted and talented in another.
</li>
<li>
Students with behavioral challenges may exhibit significantly accelerated learning but may do so intermittently depending on the impact of the challenging behavior.
</li>
</ul>
<p> 
These identifications are not mutually exclusive, and in any culturally and linguistically diverse population, many students will share identification in a variety of categories. In many ways, teachers can look for students who not only exhibit achievement or the capacity to achieve significantly above age-level peers, but in relation to their demographic peers. For example, is an English learner performing significantly beyond other English learners of their age who entered school at the same stage of English language development?

How can I differentiate instruction to meet the needs of advanced learners?
</h3>
<p>
All students can benefit from the types of strategies that support advanced learners. However, too often, advanced learners stagnate in their learning trajectory because the content, pace, and instructional processes do not meet their needs. This can lead to behavior issues, loss of interest in school, and a sense of not belonging with peers.
<br><br>
Assessment is key to determining content, pace and instructional processes. Pre-assessments and ongoing evaluation may be conducted formally or informally. Teacher observation is a powerful tool in detecting evidence of advanced learning, since it may not always be reflected on traditional assessments. Progress monitoring is essential to keeping instruction in the student’s zone of proximal development. Students who demonstrate advanced learning or the potential for advanced learning may require:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
compacted content (advancing to more complex skills/concepts within the grade level or standards from future grade levels);
</li>
<li>
accelerated pace of instruction (introduction of grade-level concepts, but with less time spent on each concept, practice, or review);
</li>
<li>
variety of instructional processes (novelty of process or product, enhanced creativity, opportunities to apply standards to student’s individual interests);
</li>
<li>
opportunities to demonstrate biliteracy abilities in creative ways (for example, contrastive analysis of thematically related poetry/literature/lyrics in two languages, role play situational biliteracy contexts in academic content areas such as explaining the parts of cells and their functions in two languages).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because <em>Benchmark Advance</em> is built around differentiated opportunities for student learning, it is an ideal instructional resource to support your students who are advanced learners. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A variety of formal and informal assessments allow teachers to pinpoint a student’s zone of proximal development in two languages.
</li>
<li>
Flexible grouping and small-group instruction for most reading and writing activities allows teachers to group student with similar levels of advancement or similar talents/ interests.
</li>
<li>
Flexible pacing and If/Then “Reinforce or Reaffirm the Strategy” instruction within the mini-lessons allow teachers to compact the content and accelerate the instruction in each lesson, within each standard, as needed.
</li>
<li>
Leveled readers and trade book recommendations on each unit topic or concept allow teachers to customize reading instruction.
</li>
<li>
E-books allow extensive variety of texts on topics that add depth and complexity, as well as novelty and variety.
</li>
<li>
Research and writing opportunities engage students in creatively pursuing their unique interests and passions.
</li>
<li>
Collaborative conversations allow students to customize learning to their interests and level of advancement.
</li>
<li>
A gradual release model (modeled, shared, guided, and independent activities) for speaking, listening, reading, and writing allows teachers to support a student’s current stage of development while preparing them to master the next stage. Teachers can move students along a continuum of depth and complexity as needed.
</li>
<li>
Project-based learning “Connect Across Disciplines” learning opportunities to promote innovation and social responsibility.
</li>
</ul>

Accommodating Students with Special Needs Throughout the Benchmark Advance Literacy Block
</h1>
<p>
As you get to know your individual students with disabilities and their current levels of performance, pay attention to the areas in which they struggle. If their disability manifests itself in one area, provide an alternate pathway for them to access the standards, while supporting growth as much as possible in the area of challenge. The chart on the following pages points out many of the opportunities for differentiated instruction already integrated into the <em>Benchmark Advance</em> literacy block, and it suggests some additional accommodations that can be implemented within your whole- and small-group instruction. These accommodations will help you meet the needs of students with a range of disabilities as well as the needs of advanced learners.
<br><br>
Struggling readers will benefit by direct, explicit code instruction in phonemic awareness and word identification strategies as part of a balanced literacy instruction program. Also, the use of implicit instruction, which focuses on context clues and picture cues, will be valuable. The use of systematic phonemic awareness and phonics instruction and numerous opportunities for practice and review will be key to successful learning by students with disabilities.
<br><br>
It is essential to get to know your students as individuals. If they are students with disabilities, it is crucial to review the IEP or 504 Plan and build collaboration between the general education and special education teachers serving the student. The same strategy could soothe one student yet aggravate another, empower one child yet incapacitate another, depending on how the disability manifests itself. For example, a student with sensory processing issues may shut down with a sandpaper phonics activity, while a student without such sensitivities may require that stimulus and thrive with it. Your broader knowledge of the student, your detailed progress monitoring, and your collaboration will allow you to distinguish which strategies are the best fit for the student.
<br><br>
<em>Benchmark Advance</em> also includes intervention materials for efficient and effective use in tutorial or small-group instructional settings. These materials focus on students who need re-teaching and practice in one or more of the four identified key foundational skills in English and/or in Spanish that are part of the Reading Standards: Foundational Skills in the CCSS for ELA: (1) print concepts; (2) phonological awareness; (3) phonics and word recognition; and (4) fluency.
<br><br>
Many of the strategies included in the following chart were adapted from those recommended in <em>Strategies for Teaching Students with Learning and Behavior Problems</em> [Vaughn, S. & Bos, C. (2012). Boston, MA: Pearson].
