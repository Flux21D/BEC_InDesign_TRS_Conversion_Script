What are the national and state expectations for students with disabilities and the Common Core?
</h3>
<p>
All students, including students with disabilities, are required to have access to the Common Core for English Language Arts and English Language Development. There are national and state recommendations for ensuring students with disabilities have appropriate access to the Common Core. In fact, the Common Core State Standards include a section on how to best provide appropriate access to the standards for student with disabilities, entitled Application to Students with Disabilities. Key elements are provided in the box on left.

</h3> 
<p>
How these high standards are taught and assessed is of the utmost importance in reaching this diverse group of students.
</p>
<p>
Promoting a culture of high expectations for all students is a fundamental goal of the Common Core State Standards. In order to participate with success in the general curriculum, students with disabilities, as appropriate, may be provided additional supports and services, such as:
</p> 
<ul>
<li>
Instructional supports for learning based on the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), which foster student engagement by presenting information in multiple ways and allowing for diverse avenues of action and expression.
</li>
<li>
Instructional accommodations (Thompson, Morse, Sharpe & Hall, 2005), changes in materials or procedures which do not change the standards but allow students to learn within the framework of the Common Core.
</li>
<li>
Assistive technology devices and services to ensure access to the general education curriculum and the Common Core State Standards.

How/where can I learn more about the types of disabilities of my students?
</h3>
<p>
In alignment with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), reauthorized in 2004, schools provide special education and other related services as a part of a guaranteed free appropriate public education to students who qualify under one of the following categories (presented alphabetically): autism, deafness, deaf-blindness, emotional disturbance, hearing impairment, intellectual disability, multiple disabilities, orthopedic impairment, other health impairment, specific learning disability, speech or language impairment, traumatic brain injury, or visual impairment, including blindness.
<br><br>
However, most of the students in special education qualify under speech and language impairment or specific learning disabilities. Furthermore, the area of literacy is the area most affected by learning disabilities. The goals and objectives addressed in many IEPs are very often in reading and written expression.
</p>
<br>
<h3 class="blue">
Create safe, respectful, and stimulating learning environments for all students, including students with disabilities.
</h3>
<p>
The first step in helping students with disabilities to achieve their highest potential is to address the learning environment to make sure it is physically and psychologically safe, respectful and intellectually stimulating. Without this foundation in place, students will not be able to focus on academic instruction. All students need to feel safe, respected, and welcomed in school. Students with disabilities will not be successful if they are anxious or intimidated.
<br><br>
The teacher must build a culture of valuing individual differences (in learning, culture, ethnicity, language, etc.). Model inclusive language and behavior. Discuss and role play situations that make students with disabilities feel included, as well as situations that may be offensive to students with disabilities. Educate all students about the types of disabilities of classmates. Have zero tolerance for any type of teasing or bullying. Reinforce the value of individual differences.

How do I plan, deliver, and assess instruction for the students with disabilities in my class?
</h3>


<b>
1. Get to know your students with disabilities as individuals.
</b>
<p>
Students with disabilities represent the full range of diversity regarding culture, language, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, age, gender, and more, and they are simultaneously members of these multiple demographic groups. The challenges they face may be compounded if their individual differences are not appreciated. In fact, an asset-oriented approach is essential to successful learning for students with disabilities. Like all students, they want to fit in and feel included as part of the class. No modifications, accommodations, or expert lesson plans can mitigate the feeling of not being accepted. Getting-to-know-you activities for all students are very important.
</p>
<br>
<b>
2. Utilize the Individual Education Program (IEP) or 504 Plan.
</b>
<p>
All students eligible for special education services are required to have an IEP, according to federal law. It is important to view the IEP as a working document. The IEP is developed by a multidisciplinary team in which “parents are considered equal partners with school personnel,” according to the Individual with Disabilities Education Information Act, (IDEIA, 2004). In addition to demographic information, including the category of program eligibility and signature page, it is critical for teachers to be very familiar with the following IEP components and utilize them in instructional planning:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
student’s current level of educational performance and social-emotional functioning;
</li>
<li>
measurable goals and objectives to address individual needs;
</li>
<li>
related services and program modification/supports;
</li>
<li>
the extent to which the student will not participate in general education;
</li>
<li>
the level of participation in district/state assessments and testing modification and accommodations, if any;
</li>
<li>
transition services at age 16.
</li> 
</ul>
<p>
Of particular use in instructional planning are the IEP sections on current levels, goals and objectives, and modifications and supports.
</p>
<br>
<b>
3. Build collaboration between the general education and special education teachers.
</b>
<p>
It is required that students with disabilities be educated in the least restrictive environment. While that environment varies depending on the individual needs of the student, most students with mild and moderate disabilities are included in general education classrooms for much of the day with support from the special education teacher. Effective collaboration between the general education teacher and the special education teacher is essential. 
<br>
The general education teacher is often viewed as the grade-level curriculum expert while the special education teacher often provides resources and suggests modifications and accommodations. This collaboration should include co-designing instruction, joint progress monitoring, shared assessments, and co-teaching. For collaboration to be effective, it is very important that time be specifically given for this process.
</p> 
<b>
4. See <em>Accommodating Students with Special Needs Throughout the Literacy Block</em> to learn more about how to differentiate instruction using the specially designed features in <em>Benchmark Advance</em>.
</b>
<p>
This literacy program includes flexible grouping and differentiation for all students as well as repeated opportunities to individualize for a heterogeneous student population, including students with disabilities in English and Spanish. Numerous evidence-based instructional strategies that are effective for all learners are repeated throughout the Teacher Resource Systems. This section highlights features of the instruction that provide opportunities to differentiate content, process, and assessment. With this type of instructional materials, accommodations and modifications are a natural match. Teachers will find these carefully constructed differentiation strategies very helpful when planning and implementing literacy or biliteracy instruction.
<br><br>
There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all accommodation or modification. You will want to strategically select the accommodation or modification that fits your individual student, maximizes on his/her strengths, and minimizes the impact of the disability.
<br><br>
<em>Accommodations</em> are changes that help a student to overcome or work around the disability. Accommodations do not reduce the learning or performance expectations but allow the student to complete an assignment or assessment with a change in presentation, response, setting, timing, or scheduling so that learners are provided equitable access during instruction and assessment.
<br><br>
Unlike accommodations, <em>modifications</em> are adjustments to an assignment or assessment that changes what is expected or measured. Modifications should be used with caution as they alter, change, lower, or reduce learning expectations and can increase the gap between the achievement of students with disabilities and expectations for proficiency. Examples of modifications include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Reducing the expectations of an assignment or assessment (completing fewer problems, amount of materials, or level of problems to complete);
</li>
<li>
Making assignments or assessment items easier;      
</li>
<li>
Providing clues to correct responses;
</li>
<li>
Strategic use of primary language.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Accommodations and modifications should be designed on an individual student basis, not on the basis of category of disability.
<br><br>
When a student is taught by multiple teachers, it is recommended that accommodations and modifications be the same across instruction classroom tests. However, some accommodations and modifications may be appropriate only for instructional use and may not be appropriate for standardized assessments. It is very important that teachers are well informed about state policies regarding accommodations for state assessments.

What do I need to do differently for English learners with special needs?
</h3>
<p>
Individual Education Programs for English learners with disabilities should include linguistically appropriate goals and objectives in addition to all the supports and services the student may require due to his or her disability. Typically, sheltering strategies are very powerful accommodations for students with special needs who are also English learners. Choose the strategies that meet both the learning need due to the disability and the current stage of English language development. Remember to think about the many aspects of the individual (culture, age, home language, socioeconomic level, and more). For example, wait time is both a common accommodation for students with disabilities who need additional time to process information and for English learners who require additional time to process the second language. Some of the strategies include visuals (photos, diagrams with labels, illustrations), manipulatives, realia (real objects), hands-on activities, total physical response (TPR), gestures, graphic organizers, sentence frames, and other accommodations that minimize language barriers and maximize comprehension of the concepts. It is important to note that under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), a student who is performing below grade level may not be determined to have a specific learning disability if the student’s performance is primarily a result of limited English proficiency or is due to a lack of appropriate instruction.
</p>

<h3 class="blue">
What types of support are needed for students with Autism Spectrum Disorders?
</h3>

<p>
Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) represent the fastest growing population of students with disabilities. Students with ASD experience many challenges, especially in the area of social awareness—understanding how their behavior and actions affect others and interpreting the nonverbal cues (body language) of others (Constable, Grossi, Moniz, and Ryan 2013). Having difficulty recognizing and understanding the thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and intentions of others can be problematic in terms of achieving the Common Core English Language Arts standards that require communication and collaboration as well as those that require interpreting the feelings, thoughts, and intentions of characters or real persons. Teachers of students with ASD need to understand how these difficulties manifest themselves in the classroom in relation to the standards as well as how to provide instruction for these students to comprehend and write narratives related to the task at hand. Although some students with ASD are able to answer questions such as who, what, and where, they often struggle answering questions asking how and why. These issues become progressively more challenging as the demands to integrate information for various purposes increase at the secondary level. Teachers can find supports to enhance comprehension and ameliorate potentially anxious and stressful experiences by incorporating cognitive behavioral strategies identified by the National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorders. Among important considerations are the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Physically positioning oneself for face-to-face interactions and establishing attention; </li>
<li>Providing verbal models for specific tasks; </li>
<li>Responding to students’ verbal and nonverbal initiations;</li>
<li>Providing meaningful verbal feedback; </li>
<li>Expanding students’ utterances; </li>
<li>Ensuring students have the prerequisite skills for a task; </li>
<li>Breaking down tasks into manageable components; </li>
<li>Knowing and using what students find motivating; </li>
<li>Ensuring the use of appropriately challenging and interesting tasks.</li>
