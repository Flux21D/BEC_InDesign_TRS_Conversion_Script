Getting Ready for Whole-Group Instruction: 
What’s in the Bag?

Choose different objects to place in brown paper bags to use during this activity. For example, you might choose to use a clean dish sponge, a toothbrush, a tennis ball, a stuffed animal, or a sock.
</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong> 
<em>
We are going to play a game called What’s in the Bag? I am going to choose one student to reach into a bag, feel what’s inside, then describe to the class what they feel. Everyone must listen carefully to the clues and think of what could be inside. We will have only five chances to guess what the item is, so think carefully before you speak. It will be our job to predict what we will find in the bag using the evidence that we have. Please notice that our predictions become more accurate as we acquire more information.
</em><br><br>
</p>
<p>Call on a student to begin the game. Direct the student to reach into the bag to feel what is inside. Without looking at the object, the student needs to describe what he or she feels to the class. Once the student is finished describing what’s inside the bag, call on students to guess the object. After five attempts, have the first student pull the object out to see if anyone guessed correctly.<br><br>
Repeat the game a few more times with other bags of objects, giving students additional attempts to use clues to make predictions. Remind students to be thoughtful of their communication skills while they play the game.

Read-Aloud: Making Predictions
</h3>
<p>
Call students to the whole-group meeting area. Remind them to push their chairs in and walk quietly. Have chart paper and markers available if you wish to make a Making Predictions chart.

<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
How did you guess what was in each of the bags?
</em>
</p>
<p>
Answers might include: by using the clues that were given, by eliminating ideas because of the clues, or by using what I know about each clue.
</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong> 
<em>
So, you made guesses based on your background knowledge and information that was given to you. You were actually making predictions. You can also make predictions when reading a book. This is another strategy readers use when reading a book. I will show you what it looks like when I make predictions. As you listen to the story, make your own predictions and see if they are similar to or different than mine.
</em>
</p>
<p>
Read aloud from the book of your choice. Make a prediction based on the title or front cover. Make sure to explain which clues helped you make your prediction. Consider using words from the text, pictures, or even the title as evidence to support the prediction. Stop to make other predictions throughout the book when appropriate. <br><br>
Suggested stems include:</p>
<ul>
<li>This book is going to be about ________________.</li>
<li>I wonder whether ______________.</li>
<li>My prediction is changing because ____________.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<p>After the story is over, ask students to turn and talk about how their predictions changed or shaped their understanding of the book.

Reading Workstation: Practice Making Predictions
</h3>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
We are going to practice making predictions with partners today. From the basket, you and a partner will choose a picture book that neither of you have read before. You will find a quiet place in the room to sit together and read. You will each need a pencil and a recording chart. Once you and your partner get settled, you each will look at the cover of the book, read the title, and make a prediction about what you think the book is going to be about. You each will record your predictions on the sheet. Half of the sheet is for Partner A to write on and the other half is for Partner B to write on.</em></p>
<p>Model creating a Partner Predictions Chart.</p>
<table class="workstation_table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>
Partner A Predictions
</th>
<th>
Partner B Predictions
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
Once you have both written your predictions, you will take turns reading a page aloud to your partner. After the reader is finished reading, the listener will make a prediction and write it on the recording sheet. The listener then becomes the reader, reading the second page aloud. The new listener is now the writer, recording a new prediction on the sheet when the reader has finished his or her section.
</em>
</p>
<p>
Choose a student to model the activity so that students can see what is expected of them. Make sure to sit shoulder-to-shoulder or side-by-side as you model.
</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
When you buddy read, you will sit shoulder-to-shoulder or side-by-side so each of you can see the pictures and the words. What questions do you have before we begin?
</em>
</p>
<p>
Ask students to go ahead and begin buddy reading and writing predictions. Monitor students as they read and write. Answer any questions as needed. <br><br>
Once everyone has finished, praise students for meeting classroom expectations. Suggest  any skills you would like the students to work on next time.
</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
Now that we have practiced buddy reading, we can add it to our Reading Workstation as a choice. For now, we will continue to practice using the Partner Predictions chart when choosing to buddy read during the Reading Workstation.
</em>
</p>
<p>
Decide how students will choose to buddy read at this station. One suggestion is to have a sign-up chart for students who wish to buddy read. This way, another student can read the list to determine who to ask to buddy read. You may choose to model this process with a student so that everyone will know what to do.

Model: Writing a Book Recommendation

<p>
Determine a structure for book recommendations that you would like the class to use. It could be in the form of a recording sheet or a paragraph. There are many forms and templates on the Internet to choose from.

<strong>
Say:

<em>We have read a lot of books so far this year, and there are still so many more to read. Sometimes we hear about new books from our librarian, a teacher, or even someone at home, like a brother, sister, a parent, or grandparent. Sometimes great book ideas come from our friends and classmates, too! We are going to learn how to write a book recommendation so that you can share more books with each other. Let’s practice with the book I used for read-aloud today.</em>

We are going to get back in our reading partner groups to practice writing a recommendation for the book you read together. Work together to decide the best information to share with your classmates about the book.

</p>
<p>
Walk around and confer with students. Note any students that are on the right track with their writing, and ask them if they would like to share their writing with the class later. After ten minutes have passed, give students a signal letting them know they have five more minutes to finish their recommendations before you collect them. Ask students you have selected to share their writing. Then place their writing into their writing notebooks.
