Smooth Transitions 
</h3>
<p>If students sit at tables or in groups, you may want to call one table at a time to transition
to the whole-group meeting area by using a signal, such as a hand bell, clapping, or
flashing the lights. Remind students to push the chair in quietly and walk silently to the
meeting area.

<h3 class="blue padding-none padding-top-20">
Getting Ready for Whole-Group Instruction:
Creating a Collaborative Atmosphere within Reader’s
Workshop
</h3>
<p>Have the Respectful Conversations chart and sentence stems available as you review
the skills needed to have respectful conversations. You may decide to have students in
a whole-group sitting area for this activity or after directions have been given, students
could stand next to their partners.
</p>
<p class="blue"> <strong> Say</strong><strong>: </strong> <em>This idea of respectful conversations is so important that we are going to continue
practicing it today and probably in the future again, too. Take a look at our chart
from yesterday. Which skills on the chart do you think are most helpful to use in a
conversation? Why?</em>
</p>
<p>Allow students the opportunity to share their thinking with the whole group. Remind
students that respectful conversations happen both in small groups and in the large
group, so there are many opportunities in the day to practice.
</p>
<p class="blue"> <strong>Say: </strong> <em>I am going to put up another set of pictures to choose from. This time, you will
work with a new partner. Take a moment to look at the pictures and decide which
activity you like the best and why. Think about how you might share this information
with a partner. Take turns speaking and listening. Remember, we are practicing
respectful conversations so think about your body language, making eye contact, and
trying out some of our stems.</em>
</p>
<p>Give students a few minutes to practice. Pay attention to what students are saying
and how they are talking with one another. When the group is finished talking, take
a moment to praise students for their good listening and speaking skills. Offer a few
suggestions for how students can strengthen their skills.

<p>Model how you expect students to write letters. This may include a greeting, a date, and
a closing. You may also choose to be very specific regarding the number of paragraphs.
If desired, the content in the graphic organizer can be transferred directly to a one-paragraph
letter, or it can be expanded to include more paragraphs with greater detail.

Persuasive Writing
</h3>
<p>Have students write independently for fifteen minutes while you monitor the class.
Depending on the needs of your class, you may decide that they are ready to begin
writing their own opinion letters. If the class needs a more structured writing experience,
consider using the graphic organizer to write a letter from the opposing view.
</p>
<p>If you choose to have students write a new opinion piece,</p>
<p class="blue"> <strong>
Say: 
</strong><em>Now that we have
practiced using a graphic organizer to plan and write our letters, we are going to write
our own. Take out your list of opinion writing topic ideas. Put a star next to the one
you would like to start writing today. I will pass out a graphic organizer for you to start
planning your piece. We will take about ten minutes to get our ideas down on paper.</em>
</p>
<p>Monitor students as they begin completing the graphic organizer. Support students who
many need additional help narrowing down their topic or clarifying their position on the
issue. After ten minutes, use a signal to gather the attention of the students.
</p>
<p>Use a Stand-Up, Hand-Up, Pair-Up activity to divide the class into pairs. Tell partners
to take turns discussing their topics. Remind students to practice having respectful
conversations and refer to the anchor chart if needed.
