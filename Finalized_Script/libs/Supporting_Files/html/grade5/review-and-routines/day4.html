<li>I like/don’t care for ______________ because _____________________.</li>
<li>I agree/disagree with you because ___________________.</li>
<li>Why do you think that?</li>
<li>Where can I find that in the text/story?</li>
<li>Could you explain what you mean?</li>

favorite season, favorite activity, or favorite food item.
</p>
<p class="blue"> <strong> Say</strong><strong>: </strong> <em> Now let’s practice a respectful conversation. I am going to show you a group of
pictures. Decide which you like the best and why. Think about how you might share
this information with a partner. Take turns speaking and listening. Remember, we are
practicing respectful conversations, so think about your body language, making eye
contact, and trying out some of our stems.</em>
</p>
<p>Give students a few minutes to practice. Pay attention to what students are saying
and how they are talking with one another. When the group is finished talking, take
a moment to praise students for their good listening and speaking skills. Offer a few
suggestions for how students can strengthen their skills.

</p>
<p>Read the book aloud to the class. Afterward, pair students up to practice respectful
conversations using the suggested questions below or other questions you wish to use.
Remind students to use the stems that were introduced at the beginning of Reader’s
Workshop.
</p>
<p><strong>Suggested Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the main point of the story?</li>
<li>What are some supporting details?</li>
<li>Did the author make the point successfully? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Do you agree or disagree with the point the author is trying to make?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the class has had a few minutes to talk with one another, ask them to finish up
their conversations and turn themselves toward the front of the room. Briefly share what
you noticed about the conversations. Pay particular attention to addressing positive
attempts to use stems, body language, and eye contact appropriately. If needed, suggest
skills the class can continue to work on.

<p>
Decide on where the students are going to keep their
writing. They can keep loose papers in a writing folder.
They can also have a response journal that could be
divided into sections for multiple uses. The sections
could include: brainstorming ideas, interesting
words, response to reading, drafts, and reading
comprehension strategies.
