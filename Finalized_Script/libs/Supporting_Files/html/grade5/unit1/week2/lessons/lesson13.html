<article class="Lesson">
<h2>Engage Thinking</h2>
<p>Review with students that during the drafting stage of the writing process, writers begin putting their ideas into an organized text. A draft is not a finished piece; it is the place for writers to put all of their ideas down. Tell students that you will show and discuss a first draft of a reflection based on the model lesson prompt.</p>
<h2>Model</h2>
<p>Display and read aloud an exemplar reflection.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Strong opening introduces first-person narrator and situation</p>
<p>Careful verb use helps the reader go between past and present</p>
<p>Clear sequence of events unfolds naturally; transition words help manage the sequence of events</p>
<p>Narrator shares her thoughts and feelings about events, using concrete words and sensory details</p>
<p>Reflection has a sense of closure</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>My goodness, I cannot believe so much time has passed. When I think about how many years all this court nonsense has taken, I am completely exhausted. There were many days when I thought I should just give up, that I should just let Dred Scott and his family have their freedom. However, I was determined to fight.</p>
<p>It all began when my beloved husband died in 1843. I was devastated and frightened. Naturally, John left the slaves to me. I was surprised when Dred asked if he could buy his freedom. Certainly not. He was my property, and I needed the income I received from hiring him out to others. What else was I to live on? I never expected we would go to court, and I never expected to lose. Of course I had to appeal that ruling in 1847, and I thought the decision in 1852 was the end of it. It was not. Not until 1857 did we get the final court decision.</p>
<p>With that last decision by the Supreme Court I was so relieved. I never expected that Peter Blow’s family would buy and free the Scotts. I was stunned. I did respect Dred and his unending pursuit of freedom. I never wanted to harm him or his family, since I’ve known them for so many years. I hope they find a new life and are happy now. I am content to be at home, and I never want to see the inside of a courtroom again.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="table_label">Unit 1 Exemplar Reflection Draft</p>
<p>Invite students to tell you what they notice about this reflection. Use their ideas as a starting point to help model elements of the draft, and include in your discussion all the points listed in the left column.</p>
<h2 class="productive_engagement_iELD">Productive Engagement: Partner</h2>
<p>Ask students to work with a partner to draft a few sentences of another possible reflection from Eliza Emerson. Tell them this reflection should focus only on her thoughts and feelings about the first case that Dred Scott won and that she appealed. Select one student to act as notetaker, but have both students contribute to the partner writing. Remind students that their draft should incorporate at least some of the elements of a reflection that you discussed. Explain that you do not expect students to draft an entire reflection, just a few sentences.</p>
<h2>Share</h2>
<p>Invite volunteers to read aloud their sentences to the class and to identify the elements of a reflection that they were able to incorporate.</p>
<h2>Build Language: Recognize Shifts in Verb Tense and Identify Perfect Tense</h2>
<p>Explain that in narrative writing, narrators will be in one time looking back at a previous time. These shifts in time require a shift in verb tense. Students may want to include a time shift in their fictional reflection. If so, they will want to make sure they use verb tenses correctly. Point out and reread this example from the draft reflection:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p>My goodness, I cannot believe so much time has passed. When I think about how many years all this court nonsense has taken, I am completely exhausted. There were many days when I thought I should just give up, that I should just let Dred Scott and his family have their freedom. However, I was determined to fight. . . .</p>
<p>I did respect Dred and his unending pursuit of freedom. I never wanted to harm him or his family, since I’ve known them for so many years. I hope they find a new life and are happy now.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Draw students’ attention to the verbs <strong>believe, think, am, were</strong>, and <strong>thought</strong>. Explain where the shift happens between present (believe, think, am) and past (were, thought). Remind students that writing about the past requires using a past tense verb. Writing about the present requires a present tense verb.</p>
<p>Point out that writers also use the perfect tense in their writing. They use the perfect tense when discussing unfinished actions or situations, changes over time, or life experiences. Examples of the perfect tense include; I’ve been to France; I’ve loved ice cream my whole life; or, She has been my friend since childhood. </p>
<p>Work with students to find a shift in verb tense and the perfect tense in the exemplar text. (Students should find the shift in end of the first paragraph. The last two sentences shift back to the present tense. The perfect tense example is in the second paragraph.)</p>
<h2>Manage Independent Writing</h2>
<p>Ask students to draft their own reflection using the prompt on page 21 of their Texts for Close Reading. Students can write their draft during independent time or as homework. </p>
</article>
<footer class="standards">
<p><strong>W.5.3a</strong> Orient the reader by establishing a situation and introducing a narrator and/or characters; organize an event sequence that unfolds naturally. <strong>W.5.3b</strong> Use narrative techniques, such as dialogue, description, and pacing, to develop experiences and events or show the responses of characters to situations. <strong>W.5.3c</strong> Use a variety of transitional words, phrases, and clauses to manage the sequence of events. <strong>W.5.3d</strong> Use concrete words and phrases and sensory details to convey experiences and events precisely. <strong>W.5.3e</strong> Provide a conclusion that follows from the narrated experiences or events. <strong>W.5.4</strong> Produce clear and coherent writing in which the development and organization are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience. <strong>W.5.5</strong> With guidance and support from peers and adults, develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach. (Editing for conventions should demonstrate command of language standards 1–3 up to and including grade 5.) <strong>W.5.10</strong> Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of discipline-specific tasks, purposes, and audiences. <strong>L.5.1b</strong> Form and use the perfect (e.g., <em>I had walked; I have walked; I will have walked</em>) verb tenses. <strong>L.5.1c</strong> Use verb tense to convey various times, sequences, states, and conditions.</p>
