Maximizing the Quality of Classroom Collaborative Conversations
</h1>
<em>by Jeff Zwiers, Ed.D.</em>

<p>
Productive classroom conversations include many features and require many skills. Fortunately, most of these features and skills can be modeled and scaffolded. The mini-lessons in your <em>Benchmark Advance</em> Teacher Resource System offer a wide range of conversational opportunities and helpful scaffolds to support rich conversations. For these conversations to be successful learning experiences, however, teachers must adapt lessons to meet the unique needs of their students. This article outlines several teacher habits, skills, and ideas for maximizing the quality of students’ collaborative conversations in every unit of the program.
<br><br>
There are two common types of conversations that take place in the classroom. In the first, participants build up an idea together. In the second, participants discuss multiple ideas in order to choose one idea over another. An idea can take many forms: an answer to an essential question, an opinion, an inference, a hypothesis, a description of a complex process, a solution to a problem, a theme in a story, a comparison, etc.
<br><br>
Teachers and students can better understand how to improve conversations with the tools that accompany the <em>Benchmark Advance</em> program. The first tool, the <em>Conversation Blueprint</em>, is a visual guide to help teachers scaffold students’ conversations. This tool shows the structure of the two main types of conversations that should happen during lessons.
<br><br>
The tools especially designed for students are the <em>Think-Speak-Listen Bookmarks</em> for grades K–1 and the <em>Think-Speak-Listen Flip Book</em> for Grades 2–6. These tools offer sentence stems for various skills within a conversation. Each bookmark focuses on a specific conversation skill. The flip book provides stems for expressing and eliciting general ideas as well as stems for clarifying, supporting, and discussing the choice of one idea over others.

Building up an idea together
</h3>
<p>
To support the first type of conversation, three key skills are needed: expressing an idea, clarifying the idea, and supporting the idea with reasons, evidence, examples, and explanations. First, students express an idea relevant to the conversation prompt. Then students clarify the idea by defining and explaining what they mean as they use appropriate academic terms. They can also refer to the stems in the Think-Speak-Listen tools for language structures to help them pose and clarify ideas. A vital part of building up an idea is to support the idea with <strong>reasons</strong>, <strong>evidence</strong>, and <strong>examples</strong>. Usually, students need to <strong>explain</strong> how the reasons, evidence, and examples support the idea.
<br><br>
For example, at the end of Grade 1, Unit 3 (<em>Plants and Animals Grow and Change</em>), the teacher prompts students to talk about the Essential Question, “Why do living things change?” Students talk in small groups to build up their ideas together in preparation for writing about the topic. Before and during the conversations, the teacher reminds students to stay on topic, listen respectfully, and build on one another’s comments. Here is an example.
</p>
<br>
<table class="convo_box"> 
<tr>
<td>
<b class="green">Carlos:</b>

<b class="blue">Based on what I read, an idea that I have is living things change because they want to live. (<em>Expresses an idea</em>)</b>

<b class="blue">Yeah, with no tail it dies cuz it can’t eat. But then it loses its tail. (<em>Adds clarity to the example</em>)</b>
</td>

<b class="pink">Nina:</b>
</td>

<b class="blue">Why? (<em>Connects back to prompt; clarifies</em>)</b>
</td>

<tr>

<b class="lightblue">David:</b>
</td>

<b class="blue">Maybe so it can jump better. To get away from snakes.</b>
</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>
<b class="purple">Ana:</b>
</td>
<td>
<b class="blue">I hate snakes.</b>
</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>
<b class="green">Carlos:</b>
</td>
<td>
<b class="blue">So do frogs. Are we done?</b>
</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>
<b class="purple">Ana:</b>
</td>
<td>
<b class="blue">No. That’s just one animal. What about another animal change? (<em>Asks for another example; gets back on topic</em>)</b>
</td>
</tr>     
<tr>
<td>
<b class="pink">Nina:</b>
</td>
<td>
<b class="blue">Butterfly. (<em>Provides another example</em>)</b>
</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>
<b class="lightblue">David:</b>
</td>
<td>
<b class="blue">Why does it change to stay alive? It could just stay a caterpillar. (<em>Asks for clarification focused on prompt</em>)</b>
</td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>
<b class="pink">Nina:</b>
</td>
<td>
<b class="blue">I don’t think it will live long like that. Butterflies can fly to warm places and get away from birds.</b>
</td>
</tr> 
</table> 
<br>
<p>
Notice how the students use the skills of expressing, clarifying, and supporting to build up an idea during the conversation. These skills help them stay on topic and solidify their knowledge of how living things change.

Choosing one idea over others
</h3>
<p>
The second type of conversation builds on the first type. Students first build up one idea as just described, and after it is built up, they build up a second idea, and even others, if needed. After building up two or more ideas, the students converse to decide which idea is “stronger.” A good example of this type of conversation is an argument. In an argument, a person often takes a side (i.e., makes a case for one idea) and supports it to show how it outweighs the other side(s). Learning to choose one idea over others—and respectfully and effectively argue about it—is a vital skill for life, one that students should work on every year in school.
<br><br>
The Conversation Blueprint illustrates how to structure a rich conversation that helps participants choose one idea over another. Students must first build up one idea with clarifications, reasons, evidence, examples, and explanations. Students then build up a second idea, and so on. Only after students have clarified and built up each idea are they ready to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the reasons, evidence, examples, and explanations that support each idea. Evaluation means deciding how valuable, or “heavy,” the support is for an idea. For example, when conversing about the prompt, “What is the most important reason to read stories?” a group of students built up two ideas: (1) we read stories to show us how to be better people; and (2) we read stories to learn about others. They came up with examples for both ideas, and in some cases the same stories were used on both sides. They found more examples for the second idea, but one student, Brenda, argued that being better people was very heavy, even if there were more examples on the other side.
<br><br>
Then they compared the two ideas to choose which was “heavier”—that is, which idea had more convincing evidence. Manuel said he also thought that being better people weighed more than just learning about others. “I think we need to have better people, not just people who know more stuff about others.” They chose the first idea but conceded that the second idea was important, too. Indeed, this is what the teacher wanted. She didn’t care what idea they ultimately chose, but she did want them to think carefully about each idea and argue each side. Also, notice that this prompt forced students to choose an idea. If it had been, “Why do we read stories?” students could have just come up with a list of reasons and not done the cognitive work of evaluating and comparing the two ideas.
<br><br>
Let’s look at a sample conversation between two Grade 4 students who were discussing the prompt “Do earthquakes have a more positive or negative impact on our lives?” To set up the conversation, students were given time to research the positive and negative impacts of earthquakes. Again, notice how the prompt, which asked for an argument-based choice as a result of the conversation, spurred students to clarify, support, and evaluate ideas more than if they had been prompted just to describe how earthquakes impact people.

<p>
Students will never have this exact conversation, and no two conversations among students will ever be the same. This is what makes collaborative conversation so exciting and unpredictable. Just remember to keep the structures, features, and skills in mind. Use the tools as needed, but remember to reduce student reliance on them during the year. Build a culture in the classroom that values conversation and the ideas of others. In Benchmark Advance, you will find a wealth of opportunities to build such a culture, and in doing so, you will equip students with not only highly valuable knowledge and literacy skills, but also the priceless abilities to communicate with other humans and work together to build up ideas that are unique and generative.
