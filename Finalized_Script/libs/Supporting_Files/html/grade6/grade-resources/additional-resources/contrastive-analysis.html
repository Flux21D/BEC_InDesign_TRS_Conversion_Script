The Value of Contrastive Analysis
</h1>
<em>
By Silvia Dorta-Duque de Reyes and Jill Kerper-Mora, Ph.D.
</em>
<br><br>
<p>
Contrastive analysis is the systematic study of two languages to identify their similarities and differences. Contrastive analysis charts help educators recognize distinctions between a student’s primary language and English. The Benchmark Advance Contrastive Analysis Charts address the similarities and differences between English and nine of the most common world languages spoken by English learners in the United States.
<br><br>
For both students and teachers, using a language construction process that recognizes the similarities and differences between a primary and secondary language, rather than an error correction procedure, builds students’ awareness of how English works. In every contrastive analysis lesson, students benefit when their primary language is respected and tapped as a resource for learning English through an additive approach that honors their primary language.
<br><br>
All oral languages are comprised of phonemes, and each of those sounds is articulated in a particular position in the mouth. As teachers are helping students to recognize and pronounce the sounds of English (phonology), they need to know whether the students’ primary language utilizes particular sounds. If the target sound is found in the student’s primary language, it will be fairly easy for the student to articulate and use that sound in English. If, however, the sound is not found in the student’s primary language, teachers will need to provide additional instruction and support to ensure that students “hear” (discriminate) and articulate the sound in English.
<br><br>
Students will need instruction in recognizing and distinguishing the sounds of English as compared with or contrasted with sounds in their primary language (e.g., vowels, consonants, consonant blends, syllable structures). An example is the short vowel sounds of English that are not equivalent to vowel sounds in Spanish. In an alphabetic language system, phonology and phonemic awareness are the foundation for reading and writing.
<br><br>
There are many writing systems in the world. Latin-based languages, such as English and Spanish, use a writing system that is based on the letters of the alphabet; words are formed by combining different letters. Other languages, such as Chinese, use a completely different system of writing. It is called the logographic system. Each character represents a meaningful (morphological) unit. Because these two systems are entirely different, there is not a basis for comparison of the writing systems. For students who have been taught to use the logographic system, an introduction to the alphabet is necessary, and the instruction needs to include the sound–symbol relationship.

Benchmark Advance Contrastive Analysis Charts
</b>
</h4>
<p>
The Sound-Spelling Contrastive Analysis Charts compare the phonemes (sounds) and graphemes (letters) of English with nine world languages and enable teachers to compare various features at a glance, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Categories of English spellings (grapheme types, such as short vowels)
</li>
<li>
English sounds (phonemes)
</li>
<li>
English letter(s) (the most common grapheme(s) used to represent the sound)
</li>
<li>
Examples of English sounds in various positions in words (initial, medial, and final position)
</li>
<li>
Whether that sound exists in each of the nine languages
</li>
<li>
Whether the letter(s) that represent that sound exist in each language
</li>
</ul>

The Structure of the Sound-Spelling Contrastive Analysis Charts
</h3>
<p>
In order to support students who are acquiring new sounds and letters in a new language, it is important to map out which sounds and letters are familiar to students, the extent to which the sounds and letters are familiar, and which sounds and letters are new and unfamiliar. The charts indicate whether the English phonemes and graphemes exist in both languages (positive), are about the same (approximate), or have no equivalency.
</p>
<br>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Transfer Indicators in the Charts</th>
<th>What They Mean</th>
</tr> 
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Yes</th>
<td>
There is an equivalent, or positive, transfer relationship between English and student’s primary language.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Approximate</th>
<td>
This term is used when referring to phoneme variants that are considered close enough to the corresponding English language sound not to cause confusion for English learners.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>No</th>
<td>
There is no equivalent or transfer relationship between English and the student’s primary language.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>
Although some world languages use an alphabetic system for writing (e.g., Spanish, Vietnamese), they each vary in both sounds and symbols used to encode those sounds. Some sounds and spellings are fully transferable (e.g., sound /<strong>b</strong>/ can be encoded with letter b in both Spanish and English, as in [<strong>botón/button</strong>]). Some sounds that are transferable can be encoded in English using spelling patterns not found in primary language (e.g., /<strong>k</strong>/ spelled <strong><em>ck</em></strong> in English, as in <strong>duck</strong>).
</p>
<h3 class="blue">
The Structure of the Grammar-Syntax Charts
</h3>
<p>
The Grammar-Syntax charts are aligned to the CCSS Language standards and compare the grammatical differences between English and each of the nine world languages. The charts are divided into the conventions of standard English grammar: verbs; nouns; word order; adverbs and adjectives; pronouns; and prepositions, conjunctions, and articles.
<br><br>
These charts provide teachers with information relating to potential error patterns that may result as students generalize what they know and use in their home language to English. Once teachers know which grammatical structures transfer to academic English conventions, and which do not, they can adjust instruction to provide maximum reinforcement for skills lessons on these structures. For example, English is an inflectional language. In an inflectional language, verbs change forms. For example, the verb see can appear as <strong>“see,” “sees,” “saw,” “seen,” or “seeing.” </strong>Other languages, such as Chinese, are non-inflectional. Words/verbs do not change shapes. The word <strong>see</strong> 看 is always written as 看 and there is no change. In addition, the word <strong>to</strong> in front of an English “verb” such as “to go” is nonexistent.
<br><br>
When teachers learn to identify and capitalize on students’ existing language skills, they are able to use positive transfer to support student in gaining English language proficiency and biliteracy. Instructional approaches that promote students’ awareness of and understandings about language variety are particularly useful for supporting students’ metalinguistic knowledge and positive language identity.
<br><br>
We extend our appreciation to the language consultants, educators, and linguists who reviewed these charts for accuracy and completeness, and we extend special recognition to Sandra Ceja, who compiled these charts.

Using Contrastive Analysis to Inform Instruction
</b>
</h4>
<p>
The Contrastive Analysis Charts give teachers information about students’ native language usages, structures, and grammar to enable them to accomplish the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Support students’ overall understanding of how English works in ways that are similar to or different from usages in their native language.
</li> 
<li>
Identify specific teaching points where metalinguistic knowledge of linguistic similarities and differences will enable students to self-monitor and correct errors and error patterns in English in both oral and written production. This includes teachers’ use of phonological differences between students’ primary language and English that impact their pronunciation and spelling.
</li> 
<li>
Scaffold and support students’ developing strategies in gaining word level meaning of English forms, such as nominalization (converting a verb to a noun) and noting the way English words are formed (morphology), such as prefixes, root word, and suffixes that support students in deciphering new vocabulary based on their knowledge of their native language. This is especially helpful in learning cognates.
</li> 
<li>
Scaffold and support students in developing language learning strategies for increasing their ability in sentence and clause-level meaning-making strategies of sentence deconstruction (“unpacking sentences”) and for understanding phrase level meaning conveyed through English grammar and syntax in informational and literary text.
</li>
