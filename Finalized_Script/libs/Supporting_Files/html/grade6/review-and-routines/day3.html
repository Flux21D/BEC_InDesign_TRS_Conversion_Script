may have written this story. After I am finished reading, we will share our thinking.</em>
</p>
<p>Read the book aloud to the class. Afterward, discuss with the class what the story was
about. Some questions you might ask include: Where did the story take place? How did
the character(s) change in this story? What did you learn from this book?
</p>
<p class="blue"> <strong> Say</strong><strong>: </strong> <em> Think about the story. Why do you think the author wrote this book?</em></p>
<p>Allow time for students to turn and talk, then invite students to share their ideas with the
whole group. Complete the “To Entertain” section of the Author’s Purpose anchor chart.
You can then share the other titles you have chosen as examples of books that inform or
persuade. Consider reading the title, author, back cover, or even an important excerpt
from the book to help students make connections between the different purposes for reading. Complete the other two sections of the anchor chart.</p>
<p>Ask students to retrieve the book they have been reading independently over the past
few days. Students can either come back to the whole-group meeting area or stay at
their desks.
</p>
<p class="blue"> <strong> Say: </strong> <em> Take a look through your independent reading books. Do any of you think you
have a book whose purpose it is to entertain?</em>
</p>
<p>Call on some students to share their books and their reasoning. If you agree, ask
students to write their name, the name of their book, and the author on a self- note
to be placed in the appropriate spot on the anchor chart. You might consider asking
students to write whether the book is a fiction or nonfiction book as well.
</p>
<p>Continue asking students to share and add their self-stick notes to the chart. Follow the same
process for books that persuade and then again for books that inform.

Independent Reading: Previewing Books

<p>Using the established signal, call students to the meeting area. Have a few books that you have chosen in advance to use when modeling the skills of previewing.
</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong> 
<em>
Over the past few days, we have practiced choosing good books to read. We talked
about choosing a book because of its topic, front cover, and even the author. Today,
we are going to learn a few more strategies for choosing a good book. We are going to
learn how to preview books. Watch and listen to me as I preview a book.
</em>  
</p>
<p>Depending on the book, you may choose to model any of the suggested strategies
from the sample anchor chart or create some of your own. Once you have modeled
previewing a book, ask students to share what they saw and heard. Generate a
Previewing anchor chart together.

independently. Find a quiet spot in the room.</em>
</p>
<p>If necessary, remind students to transition to their independent reading spots quickly and
quietly. Set a time limit for students who may need to choose a new book. Remind them
to preview the book before settling down to read. Consider reminding students that they
are building reading stamina. Setting a specific amount of time for the class to read and
building up that amount of time can be motivating for students.

Model: A Response to Reading

<strong>
Say:
</strong> 
<em>
Yesterday we used a question jar to guide our response to reading. Today we will
learn a strategy called <strong>lifting a line</strong>. We will practice with our read-aloud book from
earlier. While I read this book, I thought the part about ________ was interesting.

</p>
<p>Choose a sentence in the book that lends itself to a response to reading. Reread that
sentence to the class.

I am going to lift this line of the book to use as a topic.

<em>
I chose this section to lift because of <u>(its descriptive language, how it paints a clear
picture, how it helps describe the character, or how it was thought provoking)</u>.

<p>Model writing your thoughts about the passage. You may choose to connect to previous
knowledge, write down questions the line made you think about, or discuss how the
author’s choice of words helped paint a clear picture in your head.

<strong>
Ask:
</strong> 
<em>
What questions do you have about lifting a line?

<p>Once all questions have been answered, direct students to look at a section of their own

<strong>
Say:
</strong> 
<em>
Take a moment to look through your independent reading books. Find a line you
would like to lift and use as a free-write. Would anyone like to share the line they plan to
write about and explain why they are choosing it?

begin writing.

A Response to Reading
</h3>
<p>While students are writing, walk around and confer with students about their progress.
Help clarify thinking or answer any questions as you walk around the room. Allow five to
ten minutes for this free-writing activity..
</p>
<p> After ten minutes, invite some students to share their responses with a partner. Clarify
any questions and praise students for the work they have just done. Highlight successes
in writing where appropriate, specifically with language choice.
