Read-Aloud: Build Good Listening Habits 
</h3>

Say:

<em>
Today we are going to read a book. As I read, think about what it means to be a
good listener.
</em>
</p>
<p>Read any book from the suggested read-aloud list, or any other available book.</p>

   <li>Think carefully about what the speaker is saying.</li>

<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
In our discussions we are going to be mindful of how we listen. Now let’s practice.
We are going to line up to find partners. When I tell you to, you are going to line up
around the room according to your birth month. For example, if you were born in
January, you would stand here. If you were born in December, you would stand over
there. If you were born in June or July, you would line up somewhere in the middle.
</em>
</p>
<p>
Predetermine a starting and ending point for your line. Remind students to spread out across the room to give all students space. Determine what signal you will use to get the attention of the group. For example, you can put your hand in the air to signal to them that they need to put their hand up in the air, stop what they are doing, and look at you.
</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
Once everyone is in place, I will use this signal <u>(clapping pattern or raised hand)</u> to
bring your attention back to me. Are there any questions about what we will be doing?
</em>
</p>
<p>
Answer any questions students might have.
</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
Let’s go ahead and line up according to your birth month.
</em>
</p>
<p>
Allow students a few minutes to get in their spaces and use one of the hand signals to get their attention. Praise students on how quickly and quietly they were able to line up.
</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
Now everyone will take turns sharing their name and the month they were born.
For example, when it’s my turn, I will say, “Hi, I’m ____________ and I was born in
_______.” As everyone shares, please remember to practice your active listening skills.
Let’s pay particular attention to the skills of quiet bodies and eyes on the speaker.
</em>
</p>
<p>
Ask students to go down the line sharing their names and birth months. Praise students for showing good active listening skills during the activity. Next have the students count off 1-2-1-2. As they number off, direct the students to partner in their 1-2 combinations.
</p>
<p>Decide what you want your students to be discussing in their partner groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students can answer comprehension questions based on the read-aloud. These questions should be projected or somehow visible for all students.</li>
<li>Students could play Would You Rather? In this game, the teacher poses questions that give students a choice. These should be projected or somehow visible for all students. The students choose and justify their answers. For example: would you rather be able to stop time or fly? Would you rather always lose or never play?</li>
</ul>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
Now, in your partner group, each partner will take turns asking and answering
a question. In round one, Partner 1 will start by asking the question while Partner 2
answers. Then Partner 2 will ask Partner 1 the same question and listen to Partner 1
answer. In round two, Partner 2 asks the question first while Partner 1 answers. Partner
1 asks Partner 2 the same question and listens to Partner 1 answer. Let’s begin. Partner
1, here’s your first question.
</em>
</p>
<p>Give about thirty seconds for Partner 2 to answer before switching roles. Continue for two or three more questions. When students have had sufficient time to practice, call the class back to the whole-group meeting area to debrief.</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Ask:
</strong>
<em>
How did it feel to practice listening? What was hard? What was easy? What
questions do you have about how we are expected to listen while we are together?

Practice Independent Reading

<em>
Yesterday, we each chose a good book for independent reading time and we
practiced writing a response to our reading. Today, I will introduce the reading log.

<p>Have an example of the reading log you plan to introduce. Be prepared to project the reading log so all can see, or have student copies available to distribute at this time.</p>

<em>
We use a reading log to document the reading we do both in school and out of
school. This log helps us look at your book choices. Strong readers read many different
genres. For example, a strong reader might read a fiction book, then a graphic novel,
an anthology of poems, and a nonfiction book. This year we will be exposed to a wide
range of genres and I hope that your reading log reflects a wide range of choices, too.
</em>
</p>
<p>Take time to walk students through the reading log and how to fill it in accurately.</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
We are going to practice completing our reading logs today after we read
independently. Please take a moment to get your independent reading books and find a
quiet place in the room to begin your reading. I will give you a signal when it is time to
stop reading and begin filling in your reading log for today.

</p>
<p>Allow students fifteen minutes to read independently before directing them to begin completing their reading logs. Monitor students as they complete the reading logs. If needed, provide time to answer any questions before moving on.</p>

<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
Since our read-aloud book was a fiction book, we are going to pull a question from
the Fiction Question Jar. Who would like to pull a question for us today?
</em>
</p>
<p>Explain to students that sometimes a question that is pulled isn’t a good match for the book. For example, if a student hasn’t finished reading a book, a question about whether you liked the ending or not would not work. You might decide to let students choose two or three questions, then pick the one they are most interested in answering.</p>
<p>Once a question has been chosen, ask the student to read the question aloud.</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
Let’s begin our response to the reading. Take a moment to think back to our readaloud.
Think about how you would start your response to this book. Who would like to
share their idea?
</em>
</p>
<p>Allow two or three students an opportunity to share their ideas. Use these ideas to begin crafting a shared response to the read-aloud book. Remind students to use proper punctuation and complete sentences when writing.</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Ask:
</strong>
<em>
What kinds of things do I need to keep in mind as I write?
</em>
</p>
<p>Look for student answers about capital letters at the beginning of sentences, punctuation at the end of sentences, and writing in complete sentences.</p>

Support Tips
</h2>
<p>
Word study components can be added to the shared writing section based on your students’ needs. Some that could be taught this week are: vowel teams /ou/, /oi/ and /ô/, /oo/, homophones (to, two, too; they’re, their, there), silent letters (wr, kn, gn), and inflectional endings with spelling changes (drop final e, double final consonant).

Independent Writing

(15 MIN.)

</h1>
<h3 class="blue padding-none padding-top-20">
Response Journals
</h3>
<p>Invite the students to return to their seats and write a response to the book they chose for independent reading time using their response journals or loose leaf paper.</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
Now it is your turn to write a response to the book you chose earlier. Could I get
another volunteer to pull a new question from the question jar?
</em>
</p>
<p>Choose another student to pull a question and read aloud to the class. If some students need a non-fiction question, allow a student to pull a non-fiction question also.</p>
<p class="blue">
<strong>
Say:
</strong>
<em>
Please remember to write in complete sentences while using appropriate
punctuation and capital letters and be sure to answer the question as you write. Be sure
to cite evidence from the text.
</em>
</p>
<p>During the last five minutes, allow students the opportunity to share how it felt to write a response to reading using a question from the question jar. Share with students where the question jars will be kept in the room for independent use.</p>
