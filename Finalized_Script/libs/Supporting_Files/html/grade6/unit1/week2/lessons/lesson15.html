<article class="Lesson">
<h2>Engage Thinking
</h2>
<p class="sample_modeling"><strong>Ask:</strong> What do you do after you finish drafting a piece of writing?</p>
<p>Review with students that after they draft, they return to their writing to revise and edit their work. When they revise, they look for ways to improve the writing by adding details or making stronger word choices. They make sure they have addressed the prompt completely. When they edit, they correct any mistakes in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. Explain that in this lesson you will model how to revise a text to make the sequence of events clearer by adding temporal, or time, words and phrases. You will model how to edit for shifts in verb tense.</p>
<h2>Revise: Use Temporal Words and Phrases to Signal Event Order</h2>
<p>Display a revised section of the exemplar reflection. Ask students to listen as you read the original text (paragraph 2) followed by the revised text. Ask students to comment on differences they notice. If necessary, point out the specific ways in which temporal words and phrases make the sequence of events clearer and more meaningful for readers.</p>

<p class="sample_modeling"><strong>Sample modeling:</strong> The sentence “I was surprised when Dred asked if he could buy his freedom” doesn’t explain to the reader that time has passed between the death of Emerson’s husband and Dred Scott’s request for freedom. This is an important detail to include. It helps explain why Eliza Emerson is surprised and lets the reader wonder, as Emerson probably did, why did he wait three years?</p>
<p>Point out the following revisions in the text in bold and explain their significance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition of phrase <em>three years later</em> tells readers how much time has passed between Emerson’s death and Scott’s request for freedom.</li>
<li>Addition of <em>second</em> lets readers know that there was another ruling before this one.</li>
<li>Addition of <em>ten long years after we began</em> emphasizes the length of the case and helps the reader understand Eliza Emerson’s feelings.</li>
</ul>

It all began when my beloved husband died in 1843. I was devastated and frightened. Naturally, John left the slaves to me. I was surprised when <strong>three years later</strong> Dred asked if he could buy his freedom. Certainly not. He was my property, and I needed the income I received from hiring him out to others. What else was I to live on? I never expected we would go to court, and I never expected to lose. Of course, I had to appeal that <strong>second</strong> ruling in 1847, and I thought the decision in 1852 was the end of it. It was not.

<h2>Edit: Recognize Shifts in Verb Tense</h2>
<p>Read aloud another section of the exemplar reflection. Point out that the narrator has shifted the verb tense between past and present to show a shift in time. She switches from remembering in past tense (<em>was, expected, did, etc.</em>) to sharing her current feelings in the present (<em>hope, am, want</em>) to ongoing situations in perfect tense (<em>have known</em>). Review that the reflection is written in present tense because it shows what the narrator is thinking as she writes. However, the narrator is remembering things that happened in the past. Writing about the past requires the use of past tense verbs.
</p>
<table>
<tr>

<p>
With that last decision by the Supreme Court I was so relieved. I never expected that Peter Blow’s family would buy and free the Scotts. I was stunned. I did respect Dred and his unending pursuit of freedom. I never wanted to harm him or his family, since I’ve known them for so many years. I hope they find a new life and are happy now. I am content to be at home, and I never want to see the inside of courtroom again.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><strong>Revised Exemplar Paragraph 2</strong></p>
<p>Explain that during the editing process, students should check to be sure they have shifted verb tenses where needed to show a shift in time. Remind students that they should also check for any errors in spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and grammar as they edit their work. </p>
<h2 class="productive_engagement_iELD">Productive Engagement: Partner</h2>
<p>Invite students to read part of their independent writing to a partner to look for places to add additional or more precise temporal words and phrases. Ask them to check each other&#8217;s work for correct use of verb tense.</p>
<h2>Share </h2>
<p>Ask students to share revisions they made during the partner collaboration. Use this time to clarify or reinforce revising and editing skills as needed and to determine which students may need additional support. </p>
<h2>Manage Independent Writing </h2>
<p>Direct students to revise and edit the completed draft of their fictional reflections. Use conferring time to meet with students who need support. Allow time for students to engage in peer review. </p>

<p><strong>W.5.3c</strong> Use a variety of transitional words, phrases, and clauses to manage the sequence of events. <strong>W.5.4</strong> Produce clear and coherent writing in which the development and organization are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience. <strong>W.5.5</strong> With guidance and support from peers and adults, develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach. <strong>W.5.10</strong> Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of discipline-specific tasks, purposes, and audiences. <strong>L.5.1c</strong> Use verb tense to convey various times, sequences, states, and conditions. <strong>L.5.2e</strong> Spell grade-appropriate words correctly, consulting references as needed.</p>
